[Oncall](https://github.com/linkedin/oncall) and [Iris](https://github.com/linkedin/iris) are solutions [developed and open-sourced at LinkedIn](https://engineering.linkedin.com/blog/2017/06/open-sourcing-iris-and-oncall) to provider a pager implementation.


## Supported Features

This client was developed in concert with the [oncall terraform provider](https://github.com/bushelpowered/terraform-provider-oncall) so it supports the minimum number of features to work with that.
